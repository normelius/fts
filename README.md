#TODO
[] Rescale axis works fine with Candlestick/OHLC. But when using Line/Area and the price goes out of the screen,
    resizing isn't done. This is probably due to the fact that we never call replotChart().
[] the buttons in chartTopMenu needs to be initialized with correct values. E.g., 5M should be standard and should be reflected
    in the button text as well.
